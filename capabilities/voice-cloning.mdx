## Voice Cloning Process

1. **Upload Audio Sample**: Provide a high-quality audio sample of the voice you want to clone
2. **Processing**: Faseeh processes the sample and creates a voice model
3. **Voice ID**: Receive a unique voice ID for your cloned voice
4. **Use in TTS**: Use the voice ID in text-to-speech generation requests

## Best Practices

- **Audio Quality**: Use high-quality audio samples (minimum 1 minute recommended)
- **Clear Speech**: Ensure the audio contains clear, natural speech
- **Consistent Environment**: Record in a quiet environment with minimal background noise
- **Multiple Samples**: Provide multiple samples for better voice quality

## Coming Soon

Voice Cloning API endpoints are currently under development. Check back soon for detailed API documentation.

<Note>
  **Status**: Voice Cloning API endpoints will be available in a future release. Stay tuned for updates!
