## Response

Returns an array of voice objects.

### Response Schema

Each voice object contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `voice_id` | string | Unique identifier for the voice (used in text-to-speech requests) |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name of the voice |
| `description` | string \| null | Detailed description of the voice characteristics |
| `gender` | string \| null | Gender of the voice (`male`, `female`, or `null`) |
| `age` | string \| null | Age category of the voice (`middle`, `elderly`, or `null`) |
| `languages` | array[string] | List of language codes supported by the voice (e.g., `["ar", "en"]`) |
| `dialect` | array[string] | List of dialects supported by the voice (e.g., `["fusha", "emirati", "najdi"]`) |
| `type` | string \| null | Voice type (`neural` or `null`) |
| `sample_url` | string | URL to an audio sample of the voice |

## Usage

Use the `voice_id` from the response in text-to-speech generation endpoints:

- `POST /text-to-speech/:model_id` - Include `voice_id` in the request body
- `WS /text-to-speech` - Include `voice_id` in the WebSocket message

## Voice Types

Voices can be categorized by:

- **Dialect**: `fusha` (Modern Standard Arabic), `emirati`, `najdi`, `hijazi`, `kuwaiti`, `egyptian`, `british`, etc.
- **Gender**: `male` or `female`
- **Age**: `middle` or `elderly`
- **Languages**: Supported language codes (e.g., `ar` for Arabic, `en` for English)

<Note>
  **Custom Voices**: Some voices may have `null` values for certain fields. These are typically custom user-created voices. The `voice_id` can still be used in text-to-speech requests regardless of these field values.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Caching**: Voice information doesn't change frequently. Consider caching the voice list to reduce API calls and improve application performance.
